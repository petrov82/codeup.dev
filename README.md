## The Codeup Dev Folder

[Codeup](http://codeup.com) is an educational company based in San Antonio, TX that offers a 12-week bootcamp and a year-long program to help people who want to become programmers learn the skill necessary to find work in the field of web-based software development.

I am a graduate of the very first cohort, and this folder has a good number of the exercises that we had to complete, as well as a basic website structure. There are more exercises in the [codeup_exercises repo](https://github.com/petrov82/codeup_exercises). It also contains some other test code that I have toyed with since graduation.
